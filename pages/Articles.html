        <p class="text-white">Running has become one of the main physical activity in recent years and research into this topic has increased exponentially, with much being carried out worldwide in relation to various diverse factors linked to this practice, e.g. physical health benefits, physiology and nutrition and psychological aspects of running. However, while much previous research has focused on athletes performance, although we can find some previous research on master athletes and elderly motivation toward physical activity or sport participation, it can be said that little research has been undertaken to try and explain amateur runners psychological, physiological, and pathophysiological aspects. Furthermore, since participation in endurance events has greatly increased, the reasons why those athletes take part in different races has become one of the main research questions in literature on the subject. Therefore, recent research has tended to be focused on trying to understand the motivation behind athletes in different endurance races such as the triathlon, cycling or different distance running events.</p>

        <h2 class="text-white">Sydney O'Neil in Expert Advice </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text-white">The “ride” provided by your shoes is determined by two aspects of cushioning: the firmness of the foam and the thickness (also called the stack height) of the shoe material between your feet and the ground. This material in the midsole is usually a type of foam, typically EVA or polyurethane, that helps absorb the impacts as your feet strike the ground. From maximally cushioned midsoles to ones with no cushion, how thick or firm the midsoles below your feet is a matter of personal preference. Some runners want a plush, soft ride for extra comfort. Others don’t want or need that much cushioning, preferring more response from each stride. The best way to decide is to try on a variety of shoes and see how they feel.</p>

          <h2 class="text-white">Kyle P. Perkins,† William J. Hanney,† and Carey E. Rothschild</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text-white">Barefoot running has recently increased because of claims of injury prevention, enhanced running efficiency, and improved performance. Advocates of barefoot running suggest that humans should run with bare feet as ancestors did thousands of years ago. The development of “minimalist” footwear has evolved with the barefoot running movement as a way to mimic barefoot running yet offer foot protection. These newer running practices have prompted researchers to investigate injury mechanisms, physiological effects, biomechanical differences, and performance effects of running barefoot versus in shoes.</p>
